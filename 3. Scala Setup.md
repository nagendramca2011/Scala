Scala Setup Tutorial
=========================== 
Scala works on JVM. 
We can works on scala on eclipse. 
Scala has Both object-oriented and functional, so it has lots of power. If you want to be a powerful programmer, scala is the way. The latest version of scala is 12.2.2.

## Features of Scala
> SEAMLESS JAVA INTEROP

Scala runs on the JVM so Java and Scala stacks can be freely mixed for totally seamless integration.
> TYPE INFERENCE

So the type system doesn't feel so static. Don't work for the type system. Let the type system work for you!
> CONCURRENCY & DISTRIBUTION

Use data-parallel operations on collections, use actors for concurrency and distribution or futures for asynchronous programming.
> TRAITS

Combine the flexibility of Java-style interfaces with the power of classes. Think principled multiple-inheritance.
> PATTERN MATCHING

Think "switch" on steroids. Match against class hierarchies, sequences, and more.

> HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS

Funtions are first-class objects. Componse them with guaranteed type safety. Use them anywhere pass them to anything.
