 # What is Scala and Why to Learn ??

Today's topic would be Scala and why we need to learn it...

Now..  again there are lots of people not heard about Scala so then they know java..
they know other languages. They have not heard about Scala.

Scala is very important, very efficient and very fast. If you talk about World of big data, Scala is very important!


 Now... Why you need to learn Scala??
 There are multiple reasons to learn Scala...
 before that let me talk about what scala is...

 Scala was created by the person Mr. Martin, and it is promoted by Type safe company.

 Scala stands for "Scalable Language".
 Java is also scalable...
 Python is also scalable...
 But why scala is important ??

 above lanugages scalablility is limited.
 scala was make it scalable



 Java supports Concurrency.
 Why we need concurrency??
 We are living in a age or OctaCoreCPU. In our CPU, Initially we use single Core, dual core,Quad Core Machine, now we have in OctaCore CPU. When you write a program, that suport OctaCore CPU. Scala provide that feature.

 Even if you don't know of doing it, scala will do automatically for you.

 "Scala Provide concurrency"

"A Language that doesn't change the way you think about programming is not worth learning"

 After Scala it will your think in programming. It's not more about procedures, object. It says more about functions. Because Scala is functional programming. In Scala we have to focus on functions.
Scala is faster than Ruby, Phython, NodeJs and Java itself.

Java + Scala works together ??
Answer is yes!!

Java run on JVM!! Scala runs on JVM. You can develop one application use these two languages. You can make scala project in that you can write java code. 	A Java Project supports Scala code, A Java project supports Scala code. In scala we can use all the java libraries. If you know java you can learn scala in one month.
